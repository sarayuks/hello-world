Hey , sarayu here !! Learning to use github.


Hi Sarayu,

This is Satish from Denver, CO

I have seen your issue in LXD source code : https://github.com/lxc/lxd/issues/4672 to cross compile LXD for ARM64 machines.

Even I am also in the same page, please look at LXD closed issue list  https://github.com/lxc/lxd/issues/4667

Still, I am trying to cross compile LXD for ARM64, I thought we can work together to resolve this issue, because no one ever cross compiled LXD for ARM64 machines so far.

I didn't find your email id, so sending message like this. If you want to discuss further about probable solution then please reach me on my email id : satishnaidu.a@gmail.com

Thanks & Regards,
Satish Kumar Andey
